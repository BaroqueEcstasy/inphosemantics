This is to develop a web-interface to remotely access term relatedness data over varying corpora and models. The data is retrieved from a JSON object of the generic form below:

[{related-term_1:similarity_1},
 {related-term_2:similarity_2},
 ...,
 {related-term_n-1:similarity_n-1},
 {related-term_n:similarity_n}
]

Currently, this interface is implemented to run solely on the SEP-BEAGLE lexicon/model; however, the ultimate goal is to generalize this interface to run on any lexicon/model combination.
